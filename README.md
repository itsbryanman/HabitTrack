# HabitTrack
is a simple, command-line habit tracker that helps users track their daily or weekly goals, such as exercising, reading, or drinking water. It provides a visual progress chart and sends gentle reminders (if you want to get fancy). Think of it as a personal accountability buddy in script form!
